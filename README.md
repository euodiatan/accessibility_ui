# Accessibility UI

**Accessibility UI** is an npm package that gives you, the developer, the power to incorporate accessibility features and end-user customisation into your React web application. 

Features include: 
1. Accessibility Toggle to toggle accessibility view on or off on your webpage.
2. Pre-set accessibility settings such as appropriate color contrast and sizing.
3. Customisation page template for your end-users to tailor their experience by adjusting the UI elements to their preference.

We encourage developers to use this package as a skeleton to incorporate more accessibility customisation features. We hope that this will help foster a community of developers that hope to make applications more accessibility-friendly.
